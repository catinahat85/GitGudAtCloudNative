# Learning Resources

## Cloud Computing Basics
Training for a new career? Looking to move into a sector in tech? Are you a hobbyist? Need to get certified?
Here are some resources for learning the basics of cloud computing, where to start deploying your workloads, and comparisons between different CSPs. I'll also give you my opinions on the best way to start and why. Feel free to expand on these.

## Cloud Native Technologies
What the &^$% is Cloud Native you say? Well, I got you. 
I'm here to let you know that you need to learn:
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Service Meshes
- CI/CD

Most workloads in the cloud are integrating one or all of these, so there's no escaping them.
I've compiled some resources for learning Cloud Native technologies, why they're important, and where to start. Normally, you'd start here once you have a firm grasp of Cloud computing and need to understand how companies scale their apps, decentralize their solutions, and implement observability.
