# Learning Resources for Cloud Computing and Cloud Native Technologies

Welcome to the **Learning Resources** section of GitGudAtCloudNative! Whether you’re **training for a new career in tech**, looking to **advance your cloud knowledge**, a **hobbyist** exploring new tech, or someone seeking **certifications** to validate your skills, this repository has resources to get you started and guide you through more advanced topics.

## Cloud Computing Basics

**Training for a new career? Moving into tech? Just curious?** Whatever brings you here, we’ve got resources for learning the **fundamentals of cloud computing**. Start with the basics and gradually move to more advanced topics, covering:

- **Core Cloud Concepts**: Understand what cloud computing is, its service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and its deployment models (public, private, hybrid, multi-cloud).
- **Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)**: Explore the top providers – **AWS**, **Microsoft Azure**, **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, and others – to understand their offerings, strengths, and best use cases.
- **Getting Started with Workloads**: Resources on deploying your first workloads, basic infrastructure management, and cost-effective practices.
- **Comparing CSPs**: Get insights into each provider’s unique features, pricing structures, and regions to make informed decisions on which to use.

Plus, I’ll share my personal opinions on the best way to start and why I recommend certain approaches over others. **Feel free to contribute** if you have resources or insights to add!

## Cloud Native Technologies

So, what the &^$% is **Cloud Native**? Cloud Native technologies are the backbone of scalable, resilient applications in the cloud. They’re the tools and practices that allow organizations to develop, deploy, and manage applications that take full advantage of the cloud environment. Here’s where to start and what you need to know:

### Core Cloud Native Tools

- **Docker**: The foundational technology for containerization, allowing apps to run consistently across environments.
- **Kubernetes**: The gold standard for container orchestration, enabling the management, scaling, and automation of containerized applications.
- **Service Meshes**: Tools like Istio and Linkerd that provide reliable communication, security, and monitoring between services within an app.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment tools such as Jenkins, GitLab CI, and GitHub Actions for automating the build, test, and deployment processes.

### Why You Need Cloud Native Skills

Most cloud-based workloads integrate one or more of these tools, making knowledge of Cloud Native technologies essential. Learning these will help you understand how companies:

- **Scale Applications**: Ensure applications can grow and handle large user bases or traffic increases without breaking.
- **Decentralize Solutions**: Break down monolithic applications into microservices for easier management and updates.
- **Implement Observability**: Monitor, log, and trace applications to ensure performance and troubleshoot issues.

Once you have a solid grasp of **Cloud Computing**, jump into Cloud Native to understand the **next level of cloud operations**. I’ve compiled resources on each of these technologies, why they’re important, and the best starting points.
