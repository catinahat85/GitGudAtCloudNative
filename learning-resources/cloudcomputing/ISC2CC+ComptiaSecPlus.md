Domain 3: Access Control Concepts
Module 1: Understanding Access Control Concepts
Fundamentals of Access Control
Access Control: Determines who can access resources within an organization. Controls define permissions and enforce rules that limit users to authorized areas and information.
Security Control: Access control is a key security measure that upholds Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) by regulating user actions and protecting assets.
Key Components of Access Control:
Subjects: Individuals, processes, or devices requesting access.
Objects: Resources that subjects access, such as files, databases, and applications.
Rules: Policies determining the access level, including factors such as time-based access or role-specific permissions.
Common Access Control Models
Discretionary Access Control:
Allows data owners to set access permissions on resources they own.
Users with access can share files or grant permissions to others, creating flexibility but risking excessive privilege propagation.
Mandatory Access Control:
The system strictly enforces access based on organizational security policies, independent of user preferences.
Typically used in high-security environments where data classification levels and clearance levels govern access.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Permissions are assigned based on job roles within an organization, simplifying permission management.
Allows organizations to standardize access according to roles, reducing redundancy and enforcing least privilege.
Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):
Access is based on attributes, such as user role, location, or time of day, creating a flexible and dynamic access control policy.
Useful for complex environments where decisions are made based on contextual information.
Principle of Least Privilege
Objective: Limits users to the minimum access necessary to complete their tasks, reducing the potential attack surface.
Example: Only specific individuals working in financial roles can access payment data, while even fewer can make modifications. Least privilege enhances confidentiality, integrity, and availability by restricting access to only essential personnel.
Privileged Access Management
Privileged Accounts: Users with elevated permissions allowing them to perform administrative functions.
Systems Administrators: Responsible for systems, application deployment, and performance.
Security Analysts: Require broad access to monitor and secure infrastructure.
Help Desk/IT Support Staff: Often need permissions for troubleshooting but should be limited to necessary systems.
Security Measures for Privileged Accounts:
Enhanced logging and monitoring of actions.
Stricter authentication, often requiring MFA.
Regular audits and reviews of access logs to detect anomalies.
Segregation of Duties
Definition: Prevents any one individual from controlling all aspects of a critical process, reducing fraud risks and enforcing accountability.
Dual Control: Also called Two-Person Integrity, requires two authorized individuals to complete critical tasks. This setup prevents unauthorized or malicious activities by a single actor.
Module 2: Understanding Physical Access Controls
Physical Security Controls
Purpose: Restrict access to physical locations, protecting assets and ensuring only authorized individuals enter secure areas.
Examples of Physical Security Controls:
Locks and Fences: Basic barriers preventing unauthorized entry.
Mantraps and Turnstiles: Control access by allowing only one person to enter at a time, reducing tailgating risks.
Security Guards: Provide human monitoring and can act in emergencies.
Environmental Design: Crime Prevention through Environmental Design uses building layout and lighting to deter unauthorized access and make monitoring easier.

Types of Logical Access Controls:
Passwords: Basic form of access control, but often vulnerable to compromise.
Tokens and Badges: Provide additional security through physical objects that users possess.
Biometrics: Ensures the user’s unique physical characteristics match the stored pattern.
Logical Access Control Policies
Single-Factor Authentication: Uses one method, such as a password.
Multi-Factor Authentication: Combines factors, like something known (password) and something possessed (token), greatly enhancing security.
Common Access Control Mechanisms
Discretionary Access Control in the Workplace:
Grants flexibility, allowing file owners to determine permissions, but risks excessive access due to discretionary sharing.
Mandatory Access Control:
Enforced by system-wide policies, often applied in government or military settings.
Role-Based Access Control:
Assigns permissions based on organizational roles, which simplifies access management and minimizes administrative overhead.
Monitoring RBAC Permissions: Regular audits ensure permissions remain aligned with current job functions, especially when roles or responsibilities change.
Defense-in-Depth for Logical Access
Layered Defense Strategy: Incorporates multiple access control types (e.g., physical, technical) to create a comprehensive security framework.
Example:
Physical Lock on Server Room: Prevents unauthorized physical access.
Network-Based Access Rules: Blocks remote access to servers unless approved.
Administrative Policies: Assign access only to roles that require it, implementing the Principle of Least Privilege.
Authorization and Access Verification
Authorization: Determines access rights based on user roles, attributes, or credentials, ensuring users can access only necessary resources.
Verification Methods:
Knowledge-Based (e.g., passwords): Validates identity based on information only the user knows.
Token-Based (e.g., smart cards): Requires something the user has.
Biometric (e.g., fingerprint): Validates identity through unique user traits.
Segregation of Duties and Roles
Purpose: Ensures that sensitive processes are divided across multiple users, reducing the risk of insider threats and fraud.
Examples:
Finance Department: One employee initiates a transaction, while another approves it.
