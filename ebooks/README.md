## Ease Into Kubernetes - Free Children's Ebooks

My kids asked me what I did, and it was somehow easier for me to make these books with them in them than to explain it to them in one sitting. Kubernetes and Cloud Computing are complicated haha. Maybe some of you have experienced this! If so, please feel free to download these free ebooks that explain Kubernetes (K8s) in a kid-friendly, easy-to-digest way. 
I call this series *Ease into Kubernetes/K8s*. I hope this could spark their interest in following your footsteps and becoming cloud heroes in the future!

**Recommended for ages 0-8**
