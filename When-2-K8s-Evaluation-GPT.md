# GPT Instance for Kubernetes Evaluation

I created a **GPT instance** that casually guides **Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs)** through evaluating Kubernetes adoption, including various deployment options.

I promise this is one of the better ones. it has been fed the most up to date docs on Kubernetes, articles on SMEs and their use cases, pros and cons of adopting K8s, and thoroiughly tested.
This tool helps businesses determine whether Kubernetes is the right solution for their specific needs.

# **How do I use it?**
For the aboslute best result, your first prompt should be to tell **When 2 K8s your** use case, including details about your:
- Current Infrastructure
- Scalability needs
- Containerization knowledge
- Cloud or On-premise?
- DevOps & Automation situation
- Ongoing Maintenance
- Security and Compliance

The instance has been configured to NOT RETAIN any information, nor do I have access to your chats. However, I strongly suggest you DO NOT SHARE ANY SENSITIVE INFORMATION WITH IT. This is strictly for initial expoloratory purposes only.
